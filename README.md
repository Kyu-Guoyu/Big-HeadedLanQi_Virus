HeadedLanQi_Virus is very dangerous, so patients with photosensitive epilepsy should be cautious about downloading it!
This virus has easter eggs, and the collective approach is to open (non-running) Big-HeadedLanQi_Virus.exe, go to the \.rsrc\2052\WAVE\ directory, extract the files inside, and then add the suffix ".wav"
